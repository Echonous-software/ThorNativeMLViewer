### Data Models
**ImageView** - Non-owning view into image data for zero-copy operations [Source: architecture.md#data-models]
- data: `std::span<const uint8_t>` or `std::span<const float>` - Non-owning view of pixel data
- width: uint32_t - Image width in pixels  
- height: uint32_t - Image height in pixels
- channels: uint32_t - Number of channels (1, 3, or 4)
- stride: size_t - Bytes per row (for alignment)
- pixelType: enum { UINT8, FLOAT32 } - Pixel data type

**ImageSequence** - Owns multi-frame image data with metadata [Source: architecture.md#data-models]

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Headers**: include/thor/core/ (ImageSequence.hpp, Types.hpp)
- **Data Components**: src/data/ (ImageLoader.cpp/.hpp, ImageSequence.cpp/.hpp, DataManager.cpp/.hpp)
- **Playback Components**: src/playback/ (PlaybackController.cpp/.hpp)
- **Rendering Components**: src/rendering/ (GLRenderer.cpp/.hpp, Texture.cpp/.hpp)
- **UI Components**: src/ui/ (UIManager.cpp/.hpp)
- **Application**: src/app/ (Application.cpp/.hpp)
- **Binary Data**: data/clips/ (image sequence .bin files), data/models/ (CoreML .mlpackage files)

### Technical Constraints
- **Language**: C++20 with Apple Clang 14.0+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Rendering Separation**: OpenGL calls must only occur in src/rendering/ files, never in Application [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Scale/Bias Processing**: Apply scale and bias transformations in GLSL shaders during rendering, NOT during data loading - preserve raw pixel data in memory [Source: architecture.md#components]
- **UI Framework**: Dear ImGui 1.90+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Performance**: Sub-16ms frame times for interactive debugging [Source: architecture.md#high-level-architecture]
- **Error Handling**: C++ exceptions for runtime errors, use custom exception hierarchy [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Sample Data Files
- **data/samples/BiplaneA4C_128.bin**: Series of 128x128 images (float32, little-endian format)
- **data/samples/8S138JEBXKUX4D0N_9_224.bin**: Series of 224x224 images (float32, little-endian format)

### Validation Results

**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Agent:** James (Full Stack Developer)
**Task:** Systematic Story Validation

#### Template Completeness Validation ❌
- **CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE**: Story template file `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.md` does not exist
- **Impact**: Cannot validate proper section structure and completeness
- **Required Action**: Create story template file before proceeding with implementation

#### Validation Summary
- **File Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Perfect alignment with source-tree.md
- **UI Completeness**: ✅ **PASS** - ImGui specifications sufficient for implementation  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **PASS** - Comprehensive coverage with clear task mapping
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ **PASS** - Detailed test requirements with GoogleTest
- **Security Review**: ✅ **PASS** - Appropriate security considerations addressed
- **Task Sequence**: ✅ **PASS** - Logical implementation order with proper dependencies
- **Anti-Hallucination**: ✅ **PASS** - All claims traceable to source documents
- **Dev Readiness**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Minor technical details need clarification

#### Implementation Readiness Issues

**Should-Fix Issues:**
1. **Binary File Format Specification**: Add explicit byte ordering details (little-endian assumed)
2. **Shader Implementation Details**: Specify exact GLSL uniform names and vertex attributes
3. **Error Handling Patterns**: Clarify specific exception types for different failure modes

**Minor Recommendations:**
- Consider adding expected file size validation formulas 
- Specify texture format preferences (RGB vs RGBA handling)
- Add memory alignment requirements for image data

#### Final Assessment

**Implementation Readiness Score**: 8.5/10
**Confidence Level**: High for successful implementation
**Status**: **GO** with minor clarifications recommended

**Blocking Condition**: Missing story template prevents full validation compliance but does not block implementation of this well-structured story.
