# Story 1.3: Advanced Input Visualization

## Status

**Ready for Implementation**

## Story

**As a** ML developer,
**I want** advanced visualization controls for input data,
**so that** I can inspect and understand my data in detail.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Original Visualization Requirements
1. Show a zoom control to zoom in and out on the main image
2. Display input metadata (dimensions, format, memory size)
3. Inspect a particular pixel value of input image by mouse, showing the original input value without scaling by min/max
4. Display performance metrics of fps and memory usage
5. Maintain original aspect ratio of image when scaling to fit display area
6. Always center the image within the display window
7. Provide "zoom to fit" functionality as the default zoom level

### Rendering Architecture Improvements
AC1: Single VBO with unit quad coordinates, contents not updated every frame
AC2: Single `GLRenderer::renderQuadAt(texid, transform, params)` method, replaces all existing `renderTexturedQuad` functions
AC3: RenderingParameters contains minValue, maxValue, and num channels

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.2 Implementation:** [Source: docs/stories/1.2.story.md]
- Zero-copy ImageView design pattern successfully implemented for performance
- Shader-based scale/bias transformations correctly applied in GLSL, preserving raw data integrity
- Perfect RAII compliance with smart pointers throughout all components
- Component integration seamlessly achieved across data/playback/rendering/ui layers
- OpenGL operations properly isolated to src/rendering/ layer only
- Exception hierarchy consistently used for error handling

### Data Models
**ImageView:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#ImageView]
- data: `std::span<const uint8_t>` or `std::span<const float>` - Non-owning view of pixel data
- width: uint32_t, height: uint32_t, channels: uint32_t - Image dimensions
- pixelType: enum { UINT8, FLOAT32 } - Pixel data type for proper value extraction
- Zero-copy access pattern for performance

**ImageSequence:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#ImageSequence]
- frameData: `std::vector<uint8_t>` or `std::vector<float>` - Contiguous frame storage
- Raw, unmodified pixel data preserved for accurate pixel inspection
- Scale/bias transformations applied only during rendering via shaders, not in data

### Component Specifications
**UIManager:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#UIManager]
- RenderUI() - Draw all UI elements including new visualization widgets
- HandleInput() - Process user input including mouse events for pixel inspection
- Dependencies: ImGui, Application, all data managers

**GLRenderer:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#GLRenderer]
- RenderTexturedQuad(scale, bias) - Draw image with shader-based transformations
- CreateTexture/UpdateTexture - Texture management for zoom operations
- OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile with GLSL shaders

### File Locations
**Primary Implementation Files:** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- `src/ui/UIManager.cpp` and `UIManager.hpp` - Main UI management and new widget implementations

### Coordinate Space Definitions
**Rendering Refactor Architecture:** [Tasks 3-5]
- **Model Space**: Unit square quad with coordinates (-0.5 to +0.5), origin at center of model
- **World Space**: Origin at center of window, scale where 1 unit = 1 pixel in imageview  
- **Screen Space**: Output of vertex shader after transformations, ready for OpenGL rendering

**Transformation Pipeline:**
```
Model Space → World Space → Screen Space
Unit Quad → Image Position/Scale → OpenGL Coordinates
```

**Matrix-Based Rendering:**
- Single static VBO for unit quad (no per-frame vertex updates)
- Transformation matrices handle positioning, scaling, zoom, and centering
- `renderQuadAt(texid, transform, params)` replaces all `renderTexturedQuad*` variants
- World-to-screen transformation preserves existing zoom/centering behavior

### Technical Constraints
**OpenGL Header Isolation:** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- NEVER include OpenGL headers directly (GL/gl.h, OpenGL/gl.h)
- ALWAYS use GLFW headers (GLFW/glfw3.h) 
- OpenGL calls MUST only occur in src/rendering/ files

**Memory Management:** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Always use smart pointers, never raw new/delete
- Use span for safe buffer access in pixel inspection
- RAII patterns for all resource management

**Data Integrity:** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Store raw pixel data unchanged in memory
- Apply scale/bias transformations via GLSL shaders during rendering only
- Preserve original pixel values for accurate inspection

**Rendering Performance:** [Tasks 3-5]
- Static VBO initialization eliminates per-frame vertex buffer updates
- Matrix-based transformations reduce CPU calculations
- Consolidated parameter structure reduces function call overhead
